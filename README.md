# a-collection
A curator is selected at random to manage a museum. The curator must first decide on a rule to determine what items they will collect in their museum, for example "my museum will only contain blue items".
Players take it in turn to submit items to the collection, the curator then selects all of the items that fit the rule to enter their collection.
The players must then work out what the rule is based on the items within the curators collection.

I took influence for this game from a family traveling near me on the train.

a game must have follow a similar format:
- [game.JSON](game.JSON) - to store the details of the game
- [lib.js](src/lib.js) - a library of shared code accessible by all other code
- [phases](src/phases) - a folder filled with your different game phases
